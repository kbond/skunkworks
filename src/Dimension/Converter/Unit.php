     * For the special case of units that have a linear conversion factor, this factory
     * method simplifies the construction of the unit of measure.
     *
     * For example the relationship between meters and feet is a simple multiplicative factor of
     * 0.3048 meters in a foot. Converting back and forth between these two units is a matter of
     * multiplication or division by this scaling factor.
     *
     * In contrast, converting Celsius to Fahrenheit involves an offset calculation, and cannot
     * be represented by a simple conversion factor. In such cases this class's constructor should be
     * invoked directly.
     *
     * To help in getting the multiplication and division right, think of the toNativeUnitFactor
     * as the number you'd multiply this unit by to get to the native unit of measure. In
     * other words:
     * 'Value in the native unit of measure' = 'Value in this unit of measure' * toNativeUnitFactor
     *
     * @param string $name               This unit of measure's canonical name
     * @param float  $toNativeUnitFactor The factor to scale the unit by where factor * base unit = this unit
